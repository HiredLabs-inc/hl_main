                    Hired Labs is committed to helping Veterans find meaningful employment. Veterans
              experience underemployment more often than their peers and face unique challenges when it comes to
              translating their experience into terms that corporate America can understand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Co-founders, Alan Kumar and Jeff Stock, totally get it. Jeff, a Marine Corps Veteran, was able to make
              a successful career change thanks to Alan's open-mindedness and willingness to see the value of his
              transferable skills. Through their own lived experience, Alan and Jeff know what it takes to make relevant
              military experience understandable to non-vet hiring managers and recruiters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We offer high-touch job placement services and coding bootcamp for Vets, and training for non-Veteran hiring teams. Our goal is
              to reframe the conversation around preconceived notions of an ideal candidate and make it easier for
              Veterans to switch their code to better match that of hiring teams. We're a small team of passionate people who are committed to helping Veterans find meaningful employment.

                        Jeff, a US Marine Corps Veteran, served for nearly a decade as an interpreter and intelligence
                        collector in the Former Soviet Union, Europe, and the Middle East.
                        He led a team of signals intelligence collectors in and around Fallujah, Iraq during
                        Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) II & III, then served as an interpreter for the
                        Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). After completing his service, Jeff earned a B.A. in
                        Linguistics at UC Berkeley, and then went on to build a successful career in tech creating and leading data analysis
                        and operations teams.
