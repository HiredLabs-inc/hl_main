General updates for project development
2d8da32 added seed data for phases, steps, and participants

Bug fixes
Bug: Editing jobs throws a ValueError empty vocabulary; perhaps the documents only  stop words
Steps taken to resolve:
7dbc1a0 set minimum job description length to 30 words including stops

Outcome: The error is not thrown, but short job descriptions return 27 empty keyword rows, without creating a new
database record
