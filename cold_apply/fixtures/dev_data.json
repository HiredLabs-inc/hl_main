That's why this company have just secured another round of funding to help with the next stage of growth. If you're interested in crypto markets and love building efficient and scalable systems in Python, you've come to the right place.\n\nYou're going to be building all kinds of bespoke customizations to the core platform here. Clients get access to the platform via APIs to different exchanges but each of them has a slightly different way in which they want to see the data and ingest it into their systems. These customizations sometimes require complete re-development of some parts of the platform - this will be part of your job.\n\nAs you're joining a young company, there's still plenty to be done - they're well aware that... they're not perfect - you'll have all kinds of varied projects to work on. Most of the development work is greenfield and you'll be given all kinds of responsibilities to take the lead on things and be creative in your approach. These will be scalable, highly available, performant, low latency applications - so there's hopefully plenty to get excited about here.\n\nYou'll be joining a small team of bright, inquisitive engineers who love solving complex problems. With that, you'll need to come from a strong academic background - ideally with a degree in a STEM subject - with a few years of Python programming experience. Most of the applications are built on AWS, so experience with AWS in a Python environment would also be a huge plus and any C++ or Rust experience could also be beneficial. Most important though is that you're a great Python Developer.\n\nThere's great potential for progression here and with the steady growth of the business so far, they're not taking any risks. Demand for the product is growing and you're being hired to cater for this demand. Starting salary will be up to £110,000 depending on experience, so don't worry if you're on less than this and think you aren't senior enough, this could be your second job or your tenth job.\n\nIt's a fully remote environment, with a core base in London. On top of salary, you'll also get stock options, plus an ever improving benefits package that's typical for most start-ups/early-state businesses.\n\nWant to build greenfield Python applications for all types of crypto investors? Get in touch.\n\nNo up-to-date CV required",
